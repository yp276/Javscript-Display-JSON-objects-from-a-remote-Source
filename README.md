Exploration of JSON files 

This repository contains code for Georgetown HIDS 6001 (Massive Health Fundamentals) Assignment. This assignment first reads and displays contents of two JSON files, one containing a list of providers and another containing a list of facilities. Then, the code display all providers in a drop-down list. When the user selects a provider, the provider's address is displayed on the screen. Then, the code finds the 5 closest hospitals/providers to a given zip code in the DC/MD area and displays their distances. 

Please note, the code is contained in the "JS Fiddle code", which contains the links to the code and display.
